While loop is used to iterate over a block of code repeatedly until a given condition returns false.
Syntax:
while condition:
    #body_of_while
'''

#Case - 1
num = 1
while num < 10:
    print(num)
    num += 3
print('\n')

# Case - 2: Infinite While Loop
'''
Infinite because here there is no increament statement for num and the given condition will remain true always
'''
num = 1
while num < 5:
    print(num)
print('\n')

# Case - 3: Nested Loop
i = 1
while i <= 3:
    print(i, "Outer loop is executed only once")
    j = 1
    while j <= 3:
        print(j, "Inner loop is executed until to completion")
        j += 1
    i += 1
print('\n')

# Case - 4: While-else Loop
num = 1
while num < 3:
    print("Inside loop")
    num += 1
else:
    print("Inside else")
